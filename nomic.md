**NOMIC***

tarting point is to win 100 points
regulates 'feedback'?????
how?parodox of feedback??

mutable /immutable , >transmuted
101 rule important
:

if capitalism is a game, then changing the rules is a move. 
microcosm>autonomous self-amendment (feedback??)
is capitalism an isolated system , now equilibrium 
or 3rd law:heatdeath, frozen 0K
two-tier-system, thermodynamic, prevents to change radically in just two moves. is this master /slave system?
nomic: can be played like state, modeled on modern democracy, 
in my case capitalism?
initial 100points via dice to be achieved <boring
rule changing for example: make the points true currency, victory unimportant concern. 

initially 
clockwise each player suggests a change of rules (in my case, could be how the story of charlie and john proceeds?)
after that, all of the players vote on. <maybe that gets you points instead of dice??? 

mutable - immutable
probable the existing texts on vtex are immutable!?
what is labeled as mutable or immutable?

can be played on git like this agora nomic.
but mailinglist

RPG: so one starts with a written text and then the others follow!
play-by-post role-playing game (sim)
interactive fiction /collaborative writing <loosest rulesets
^^maybe i give starting sentence (economy related)
dice rolls to avoid cheating /favoritism<not necessary by voting 

BRING DIE AND SCORE SHEET?
SUBSTANTIVE VS PROCEDURAL
7X INITITAL SET OF RULEZ
CARDS PHYSICLA PLAY
