Carin approached us for an interview and wanted to know about our views on nuclear fusion, as she said she's going to write a SciFi novel about some alternate world.
She promised to keep our identities confidential and because we have anyway planned to quit our jobs and retreat to the farm we just bought, we agreed to a meeting. 
She seemed quite credible and trustworthy with her libertarian attitude, 
not knowing she's active within the IC, and we would be her protagonists, doomed to live the life she has made up in her sick mind. 
Also, my freak accident accident was already written in the plot a long time ago. 
Her vile intentions and greed for money left us her puppets, and we don't even know if the motivation to write this letter and send signals to earth (or what is left of it), comes from us. 
We have <a href="https://github.com/the-vtex-files/the-vtex-files.github.io/blob/master/mozilla.pdf">proof</a> that she received a lot of money, to write a story that fits the gov and the corp.
The wolf, or the wolves?, we don't know, seems to be on our side, but then, do they come from our imagination, perhaps not. It looks grim at the moment, but the wolf is our only hope.<br>
