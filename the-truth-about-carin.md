Carin approached us for an interview and wanted to know about our views on nuclear fusion.
She said she's going to write a Scifi novel about some alternate world.
She promised to keep our identities confidential, and because we have planned to quit our jobs and retreat to the farm. 
She seemed quite credible and trustworthy with her social attitude. 
not knowing she was working for the military department, and we would be her protagonists, doomed to live the life she has made up in her sick mind. 
Also Charlies freak accident accident was already written in the plot a long time ago. 
Her vile intentions and greed for money left us her puppets, and we don't even know if the motivation to write this letter is hers or ours. 
We have proof that she received a lot of money, to write a story that fits the government and the corp.
The wolf, or the wolves?, we don't know, seem to be on our side, but then, do they come from our imagination, perhaps not. It looks grim at the moment, but the wolf is our only hope.
