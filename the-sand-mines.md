John Dyson, born in Flint, Michigan to engineering parents
experienced kinds of epiphanies already as a kid:
for instance in September 1994 he saw an armored vehicle autonomously operating
on the road to downtown Detroit 
That was something he would never ever dared to talk about to someone else
his family and the people who surrounded him were superstitous indeed,
but no one would have believed him, an outsider already.
But then wasn't he the only one with clairvoyance ("one who sees clearly")?
but he had a strong wish to step beyond the conventional limits of reality. 

looking for help with college tuition
He enlisted at the tank forces straight after high school 
dreaming of becoming an officer and commanding a tank unit 
he wants to be a sergeant (backbone of the military, in combat)

However, his career plans got destroyed.
After school John was a frequent visitor of the March2success website,  
://www.march2success.com/main/index
testing and evaluating his abilities for college. 
with a bit of determination those tests were not particularly hard to solve,
cryptograpic puzzles not able to solve with a normal functioning brain.

his results aroused attention and created a link with 
the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in collab with private research/Stanford (SRI International) 
were headhunting psychic spies already from a young age.
Setting up a squad 
with special powers, a unit of supersoldiers.
From that time on they were observing him, directing him and encouraged him to pursue a career within the military.

when did they confroting him?
and discovered his paranormal abilites, he was desperate to hide.
(in the early 90s, termed Stargate project, prev.Gondola flame, SUN STREAK, GRILL Flame)

maybe they said, he had to work as a psychic spy during college?
what did they ask him to look for underground? 
maybe at first for spice, but then he detetected somth else, but they still need so much spice for the electricity they use. 
noone ever anyway did not know what they were doing on the moon.
  together with a few other supersoldiers
maybe charlie also one of them?thats were they met?

psychic warfare.
ESP abilities=extrasensory perception and used as a psychic spy, before the incident, for project grill flame.


frustrated with his job, 
just some job title, as lt.gen. now he would prefer to be in combat but
most of the time, he does bureaucrazy, this is hell
is doing some PR for the military coz of his good looks.
he misses the time when he was a searg and his squad.

On VteX subsurface warfare is dominant. 
inner/outer warfare
the action is subterrainian
mining (machines need to be protected)
are there the 'dead people stored?' in storage, is there charlies heart as well?
they are the resources for making capital.


sand ecology /mining quartz made of magma or hot hydrothermal veins fulgurite  'petrified lightning' is a glass tube formed when electricity strikes sand (is glass just heated sand?) also from atomic blasts, meteor strikes, high-voltage devices falling onto the ground (what is that a plane??) just heat basically?? heat is energy, or?  hollow with rough exterior and smooth interior.  sand = silicon dioxide. (is this diff from silicon??) melted sand= lechatelierite.= amorphous material an

In Vardoz, an autonomous region, where business can flourish 
like it's built on sand, the structure is in constant flow.  Before a complex is even finished, it gets abandoned.  
they mine both spice and bitcoin.
and rare earths, silicon etc. for the machines
moon dust (sand)

the juncture of latitude and longitude road near the Fulgur Moron Site.  there is the Bitmine, having their resources nearby, everything is so fast here, time couldn't catch up. 
 So the decision was made to make time obsolete; In the mining farms, they have 7.8646.903 billion little machines that train neural networks, 24/7 The liquid economy on the territory of Mordos on the near, yet dark side of the moon
everything is underground, if its earth facing no one can see whats goin on there A liquid economy is involved in mining not only the environment but the life-pojtential. 

not everything can be cleary detected with radar, eg the virtual threat
were there already freedom fighters or will it all start with Charlie and John now?
divock belongs to them, maybe he s the leader?
are there illicit activities going on?

maybe introduce another character? maybe a colleague, or supervisor, an evil bitch a URL (unrestricted line) officer?  
or a sand ecologist
and he threatens to switch off charlie for good,
while she is already in search for him. 
hes not dead maybe, hes in charge but sceptical.

they used it for teheran hostages, embassy, 
stanford highly involved. (Stanford research institute)(SRI)
 (and subsequently transferred to another think-tank at Palo Alto, California, called Science Applications International Corporation) (Schnabel 1997; Hyman 1996).>"remote sensing" cz other sensers as well involved. 
remote viewing (RV) <maybe like VR now.  'telesthesia'
 remote viewing describes “seeing remote or hidden objects clairvoyantly with the inner eye, or in alleged out-of-body travel.” Said to be “one of the oldest and most common forms of psi,” it is also “one of the most difficult to explain” (Guiley 1991).
this is on probability the zener cards.

DIA(Defense Intelligence Agency) to CIA<was that in red plenty


after work he goes straight to the casino (capital vitalism, hypercapitalism) to spend the tokens he earned.  
he talked with Clark Carson about the event to come, 
but then the event just killed space-time? (that was a twilight encounter)

what if in the end they discover that they arent on vtex but on earth, like this book where they thougth they are on a mission to mars, but then they just in a capsule?


charlie tries it with magnetism, compass etc, that could be next episode, kind of looking at her journey. 

first encounter at the end between C and J.
