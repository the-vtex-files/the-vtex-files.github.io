I, John Dyson, born in Flint, Michigan, to a couple of machinists, experienced kinds of epiphanies already as a child: for instance, on a school trip in August 2001 I've noticed an armored vehicle operating autonomously besides the Wolverine to Ann Arbor Train station. My second sight carries me in a state between active and passive. I perceive signals from the outside, an incomprehensible and chaotic kingdom, which can not be interpreted with words but somehow manifest in my body, mind and soul, and as a consequence turn out to be prophetic. 
I would have never dared to share my weird experiences with somebody else, as I wasn't keen to end up as a psychopatho-logical case and put on medication with crippling effects, even though my parents and other people around me were superstitous folk indeed.
Evangelical protestants, who'd just sit and wait for their god to bring on the apocalypse in the most violent manner but on the other hand repressed any signs of horror as if it didn't belong to nature and solely existed as an alien evil force.<br>
But wasn't I the one with clairvoyance, the one who saw clearly?

Despite the looming threat of decay and madness, I still had a strong wish to step beyond the conventional limits of reality and secure a top spot in technology. Every day after school I would sit down at the family computer and train my skills with game-based learning. With a bit of determination it wasn't difficult to score high, anyway, my results drew attention and created a link with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), who was headhunting psychic spies already from a young age. Only later I've learnt that the CIA was involved too. I was unaware that I was under observation ever since and deliberately driven into pursuing a career within the military. Looking for help with college tuition, I've enlisted at the tank force at the age of 18, dreaming to become part of the army's backbone and command a tank unit in combat, already imagining myself as a Sgt with specialist knowledge in high tech. 

After the blue phase of basic training at Fort Benning I was called to see my supervisor, nothing out of the ordinary, but in the office I was met by a certain lieutenant colonel Branson, who informed me that they knew about my paranormal abilities, as some of my ingame activities were unfeasible for a normal healthy functioning mind. Then, yet not recovered from this initial shock, he revealed a truly hair-raising story, allegedly whilst penetrating moon soil with radar to find spice for fuel, they got enormous peculiar subterrestrial radio interference, dirty signals as he referred to it.<br>
"There is something down there. We MUST know what it is, and you will be assigned to a special task force to find out."<br>
"That means I won't proceed to my chosen MOS, Sir?"<br>
"Correct, we will send you for AIT and pre-mission briefing to Palo Alto, CA."

Branson was commissioned to build a platoon of supersoldiers in the tradition of cunning warrior monks. The recruits had to undergo intensive training in Eastern mind-body practices and internalize countercultural principles, finally enabling them to confuse the enemy with a lot of tricks, such as precision bombardment with symbols and sounds of peace. Generally speaking, cunning warfare is all about the supremacy of the human system over technology. Upon arrival at Palo Alto, our group, consisting of a handful of otherwise unemployable freaks, got a foretaste of the concept by his welcome address, a pathetic speech, which resounds in my ears as if it was yesterday.<br>
"Soldiers of The First Earth Battalion will defy all logic and statistical probabliltiy and define the requirements of the U.S. Army for future conflict. 
You will be trained to dare thinking the unthinkable and achieve the unachievable. Programmed deficiency will be reprogrammed, how fast depends solely on you. Put simply, you will be all that you can be."<br>
So far so good.
 
My first close encounter with Charlie was at the goatlab, when we got tested on our range of ESP in groups of two. We fooled around, joking about the absurdity of competing for the title of the #1 third eye spy. I could immediately feel a deep connection between us and knew she did too. It was even scientifically proven as the success rate of guessing symbols, transmitted between our minds, was between 90% and 100%. An individual follow-up check with Zener cards indicated we were both just average. We belonged together.<br>
Orders from the very top ended carefree times of informal experiments and worst of all, it meant the physical seperation from Charlie. Subsequently I was deployed to a think-tank called International Science Applications Corporation (ISAC) with the opportunity to show my prowess by sensing underground, and there, my dreams got buried.

They requested me to jot down what I sense and thought it would be a good idea if I'd listen to the captured signals from subsoil to trigger my telesthesia. The noise was unbearable, an eerie high-pitched sound of breaking crystal accompanied by a gloomy stomping rythm, but it worked. At first I just could see a huge black box before a mysterious force pulled me inside, and after passing numerous layers of shielding an otherworldly structure appearded on my mind. 

It was made out of gold and other precious metals its components in detail sophisticated artifacts, tubes, coils and silver tentacles.
the core a black square.
definitely not something which could be engineered by humans. I was so frigging cold, was it because of the creep or of the temperature going towards an absolute zero down there?
Then the rythm formed up into a sequence of words<br>
"The demon knows the precise location and momentum of every atom in the entire universe."<br>
Over and over again it was pounding in my head. I couldn't go on any longer and ripped the headphones off my head. I felt sick and started vomitting. I've just summoned the demon.<br>
"Thanks Dyson, we now have what we were searching for, you can go for now."

"The truth shall make your free" is inscribed at the entry hall of CIA headquartes. 
Charlies death was ''just one of the risks running with scientific experimentation.''
security clearance.
my oath, 
behavior of army is outrageous and represents a blatant breach of national and international rights, geneva
 
just some job title, as lt.gen. now he would prefer to be in combat but
most of the time, he does bureaucrazy, this is hell
is doing some PR for the military coz of his good looks.
he misses the time when he was a searg and his squad.

where ware and biz meet
On VteX subsurface warfare is dominant. 
inner/outer warfare
the action is subterrainian
mining (machines need to be protected)
are there the 'dead people stored?' in storage, is there charlies heart as well?
they are the resources for making capital.
You are the hero who
is destined to unearth the truth, buried in eternity, and bring an end to the endless war.
sand ecology /mining quartz made of magma or hot hydrothermal veins fulgurite  'petrified lightning' is a glass tube formed when electricity strikes sand (is glass just heated sand?) also from atomic blasts, meteor strikes, high-voltage devices falling onto the ground (what is that a plane??) just heat basically?? heat is energy, or?  hollow with rough exterior and smooth interior.  sand = silicon dioxide. (is this diff from silicon??) melted sand= lechatelierite.= amorphous material an

 but they still need so much spice for the electricity they use. 
In Vardoz, an autonomous region, where business can flourish 
like it's built on sand, the structure is in constant flow.  Before a complex is even finished, it gets abandoned.  
they mine both spice and bitcoin.
and rare earths, silicon etc. for the machines
moon dust (sand)

the juncture of latitude and longitude road near the Fulgur Moron Site.  there is the Bitmine, having their resources nearby, everything is so fast here, time couldn't catch up. 
 So the decision was made to make time obsolete; In the mining farms, they have 7.8646.903 billion little machines that train neural networks, 24/7 The liquid economy on the territory of Mordos on the near, yet dark side of the moon
everything is underground, if its earth facing no one can see whats goin on there A liquid economy is involved in mining not only the environment but the life-pojtential. 

fter work he goes straight to the casino (capital vitalism, hypercapitalism) to spend the tokens he earned.  
he talked with Clark Carson about the event to come, 
but then the event just killed space-time? (that was a twilight encounter)
