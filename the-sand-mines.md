is frustrated with his job. 
is doing some PR for the military coz of his good looks.
he has kinda a high rank now, 
but doesn't mean anything, just some job title 
most of the time, he does bureaucrazy
he uses radar to see underground, 
the mines are underground
are there the 'dead people stored?' in storage

after work he goes straight to the casino (capital vitalism, hypercapitalism) to spend the tokens he earned.  
he talked with Clark Carson about the event to come, 
but then the event just killed space-time? (that was a twilight encounter)

what if in the end they discover that they arent on vtex but on earth, like this book where they thougth they are on a mission to mars, but then they just in a capsule?
