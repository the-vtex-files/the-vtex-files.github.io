I, John Dyson, born in Flint, Michigan, to a couple of machinists, experienced kinds of epiphanies already as a child: for instance, on a school trip in August 2001 I've noticed an armored vehicle operating autonomously besides the Wolverine to Ann Arbor Train station. My second sight carries me in a state between active and passive. I perceive signals from the outside, an incomprehensible and chaotic kingdom, which can not be interpreted with words but somehow manifest in my body, mind and soul and as a consequence, turn out to be prophetic. I would have never dared to share my weird experiences with somebody else, as I wasn't keen to end up as a psychopatho-logical case and put on medication with crippling effects. My parents and other people around me were superstitous folk indeed, evangelical protestants, who'd block out any signs of horror as if it didn't belong to nature and solely existed as an alien evil force.<br>
But wasn't I the one with clairvoyance, the one who saw clearly?

Despite the looming threat of decay and madness, I still had a strong wish to step beyond the conventional limits of reality and secure a top spot in technology. Every day after school I would sit down at the family computer and train my skills with game-based learning. With a bit of determination it wasn't difficult to score high, anyway, my results drew attention and created a link with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), who was headhunting psychic spies already from a young age. Only later I've learnt that the CIA was involved too. I was unaware that I was under observation ever since and deliberately driven into pursuing a career within the military. Looking for help with college tuition, I've enlisted at the tank force at the age of 18, dreaming to become part of the army's backbone and command a tank unit in combat, already imagining myself as a Sgt with specialist knowledge in high tech. 

After the blue phase of basic training at Fort Benning I was called to see my supervisor, nothing out of the ordinary, but in the office I was met by a certain lieutenant colonel Branson, who informed me that they knew about my paranormal abilities as some of my ingame activities were inexplicable for a normal healthy functioning mind.

Still not recovered from this initial shock, he revealed a really ludicrous story
Allegedly, whilst penetrating moon soil with radar to find spice for fuel, 
they got some really weird radio interference subterranean, dirty signals as he refered to it.
 "There is something down there. We MUST know what it is, and you will be in a special task force to find out."
So I couldnt continue with my chosen MOS, not allowed to go into the field with the rest of the platoon?
and do individual training underground, 
 and that s where My dreams got buried.

they sent me for further training and mission 

General Bernard "Bernie" Malmesbury II was not your typical general. 
like grandpop with weird ideas. 
He was building a special task force, a group of supersoldiers, warrior monks, 
cunning 
which should define the requirements of the U.S. Army for future conflict
countercultural principles, 

"we need people for the New Earth Army
'to achieve the unachievable, ..
think the unthinkable 

I first  met Charlie, 
we both were tested with zener cards.

porton down, salisbory, near stonehenge
She found out and needed to get rid of her.

are they covertly giving the funghi to citizens? high dosage, so they are constantly on a horror trip? and paranoid
maybe the exp turned out the opposite, and brainwash everyone into hippies
 the images, burnt in 'american memory'
not fallen, jumped but dropped


security clearance >john is danger
John entered to steal her leftover body. 
"The truth shall make your free"inscribed at the entry hall of cia headquartes 

shes dead, did john already steal the body?
maybe them unburied it
and he threatens to switch off charlie for good,
while she is already in search for him. 

athologists had to rip the skin off his limbs and tear his body apart, macerate it and send it in chunks to various labs for analysis. In the search for truth, Eric had to tear his father's body limb from limb.
they need to get rid of him, he could see the full truth already in 2001
''just one of the risks running with scientific experimentation.''

PRESENT:frustrated with his job, 
just some job title, as lt.gen. now he would prefer to be in combat but
most of the time, he does bureaucrazy, this is hell
is doing some PR for the military coz of his good looks.
he misses the time when he was a searg and his squad.

where ware and biz meet
On VteX subsurface warfare is dominant. 
inner/outer warfare
the action is subterrainian
mining (machines need to be protected)
are there the 'dead people stored?' in storage, is there charlies heart as well?
they are the resources for making capital.
You are the hero who
is destined to unearth the truth, buried in eternity, and bring an end to the endless war.
sand ecology /mining quartz made of magma or hot hydrothermal veins fulgurite  'petrified lightning' is a glass tube formed when electricity strikes sand (is glass just heated sand?) also from atomic blasts, meteor strikes, high-voltage devices falling onto the ground (what is that a plane??) just heat basically?? heat is energy, or?  hollow with rough exterior and smooth interior.  sand = silicon dioxide. (is this diff from silicon??) melted sand= lechatelierite.= amorphous material an

 but they still need so much spice for the electricity they use. 
In Vardoz, an autonomous region, where business can flourish 
like it's built on sand, the structure is in constant flow.  Before a complex is even finished, it gets abandoned.  
they mine both spice and bitcoin.
and rare earths, silicon etc. for the machines
moon dust (sand)

the juncture of latitude and longitude road near the Fulgur Moron Site.  there is the Bitmine, having their resources nearby, everything is so fast here, time couldn't catch up. 
 So the decision was made to make time obsolete; In the mining farms, they have 7.8646.903 billion little machines that train neural networks, 24/7 The liquid economy on the territory of Mordos on the near, yet dark side of the moon
everything is underground, if its earth facing no one can see whats goin on there A liquid economy is involved in mining not only the environment but the life-pojtential.

remote viewing (RV) <maybe like VR now.  'telesthesia'
 remote viewing describes “seeing remote or hidden objects clairvoyantly with the inner eye, or in alleged out-of-body travel.” Said to be “one of the oldest and most common forms of psi,” it is also “one of the most difficult to explain” (Guiley 1991).

after work he goes straight to the casino (capital vitalism, hypercapitalism) to spend the tokens he earned.  
he talked with Clark Carson about the event to come, 
but then the event just killed space-time? (that was a twilight encounter)
