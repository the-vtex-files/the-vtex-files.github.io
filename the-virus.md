**ii. the virus** From the perspective of the virus, it would not consider itself as pathogenic, as language succeeded in entering human tissue, the larynx and connected to the cellular level. We don’t even understand it as an infectious agent at all, we’ve been used to it from days of yore and accepted it as a gift of god. Back then it didn’t even matter, the virus just transmitted its genetic information and from host to host, and despite its rapid spread, random mutation was a warrant for healthy development. But what made it that virulent?

Disease-causing agents thrive in homogeneous environments, however, a steep decrease of noise in relation to progressive science & technology was realized by the Law of Economics. The goal of getting a sound picture reversed and what remained were discrete oscillations, newly composed by calculus.
Another threat level is nuclear fission. Ancient Greek philosophers Leucippus and his pupil [Democritus](https://pages.mtu.edu/~pcharles/SCIHISTORY/Democritus.html) ( 460 – 370 BC) already viewed the atom as indivisible matter and when the mean tropical year was still observed from earth, mankind accomplished a rather actual split of the mean solar day at a time scale of 1/86 400.
