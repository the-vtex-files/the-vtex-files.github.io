Charlie is driving the single-tracked path to the Center of Agriculture (CA),
 surrounded by the vast fields of designer wheat and its germane funghi.  
Life is spoilt on the near side of the moon. 
It is early in the day, the terminator has shifted and moon dust has settled. A long day lies ahead for Charlie, part of the administrative staff, she  

Her blind spot monitoring is off, no need for that on an exemplarily 
managed orb like VteX.
Suddenly she is sensing rustling noise and in an instant adjusts her vision to it.

Dark blurred spots in the otherwise bleak landscape- 
the movement comes together as a body
 not knowing it's approaching her. 

in the speed of light she recognizes a wolf, to be more precise it resembles a wolf, with human features
Following the decree, all foreign matter to be eliminated to avoid inconvenience.

aiming, launch and destroy in a flash
the shield of her gun opens firing the laser, striking the target

The wolf, muscular in statue, is walking up to her,  
Charlie has only the option of the standard laser, constructed by the company and usually reliable to kill any form that deviates from the citizens of VteX. 

"Hi, I'm Divock", says the wolf. "I got a msg for you." 
Charlie realizes his words, a message, that is information, which can only be processed with dangerous noise. "What format is it? I'm not able to read everything."

"It's just lossless compression, no harmful data, just all of it, and that's not much, some basic text." This is a true statement, but taking a file from a blurry creature, "Who is the sender?", usually all notifications, no exeption pass through the central server. "It is you, your past you, your language was different then though, lots of noise you were talking."  

"I don't understand, who are you, you should be terminated." 
"I'm a glitch in time, virtual matter, just like you." 
Charlie doesn't get it, she's clearly made out of blood, flesh and bones and this bloke is a hallucination, must be a virus she catched. But then she can take the file if there's something wrong with it, her system would reject it. "Here's the usb." What an ancient way to transfer files, she thinks, while the folder pops up immediately, containing a txt file, a .png and readme.md. It's not an application, she opens the file, but doesn't understand. "What does it say, I'm not able to read this." 

"That's are files you sent to John Dyson in 2021, you know John, he serves at the dark side at the moment." "Try the readme, it's mix of your past and present lingo." John Dyson, that name rings a bell, she has briefly communicated with him on the matter of the secret biological weapon, both not working on inside matters.
