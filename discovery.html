Charlie is driving the single-tracked path to the Center of Agriculture (CA),
 surrounded by the vast fields of designer wheat and its germane funghi 
rocking softly in the gentle wind. 
Indeed, life is spoilt on the near side of the moon. 
It is early in the day, the terminator has shifted and moon dust has settled. A long 730.5h working day lies ahead for Charlie; part of administrative staff, she is responsible for keeping the crops tidy and their picking before nightfall.

reap a rich harvest, because switch-off times during excessively strong winds.

The vehicle's dead angle monitoring is off, no need for that on an exemplarily 
managed orb like VteX, and Charlie is completely unaware that something is approaching her. 
Undesirable rustling noise is impinging on her auditory system, the sound hits her at once 
[ch_hanson@localhost ~]$ echo wtf
wtf
Charlie's existing potential cannot be utilized
vision adjustment is difficult in prevalent lunar near vacuum conditions.

Something must move in the fields, that doesn't make the situation easier
Dark blurred spots in the otherwise bleak landscape- 
the movement comes together as a body
biodiversity?
In the speed of light she recognizes a wolf, to be more precise it resembles a wolf, with humanlike features and agility.
Following the conglomerate's decree, all foreign matter must be eliminated to avoid inconvenience.

.exe aiming, launch and destroy the enemy in a flash (according to ..conduct of war)
The shield of her gun unbolts and the laser beam strikes its target.
The wolf, muscular in statue, is walking up to her,  
Convulsive adherence to command 
and Charlie has only the option of the standard laser, constructed by the company and usually reliable to kill any form that deviates from the citizens of VteX. 

"I don't understand, who are you, you should be annihilated and your ashes

"Hi, I'm Divock", says the chimeric being "I got a msg for you." 
Charlie recognizes his words, a message,
 that is information, which can only be interpreted with a sufficient amount of uneconomic noise. 
"What format is it? I can only read files with common standard .eXTs"

"Are you sure you can READ it? 
I don't say that you wouldn't do a good job as an interpreter but hasn't VteX fully switched to compiling nowadays?
And the interpretation of noise requires plenty of skill. hooman skill."

"It's 
 not formatted, just lossless compression, no harmful data, just all of it, and that's not much, some basic text and greyscale imagery. 
the usb is formatted with fat-32 can be navigated by a system like yours. 

This is a true statement, but taking a file from a blurry creature, "Who is the sender?", usually all notifications, no exeption pass through the central server. 

"It is you, your past you, your language was different then though, lots of noise you were talking."



"I'm a glitch in time, virtual matter, just like you." 
Charlie doesn't get it, she's clearly made out of blood, flesh and bones and this bloke is a hallucination, must be a virus she catched. But then she can take the file if there's something wrong with it, her system would reject it. "Here's the usb." What an ancient way to transfer files, she thinks, while the folder pops up immediately, containing a txt file, a .png and readme.md. It's not an application, she opens the file, but doesn't understand. "What does it say, I'm not able to read this."
"That's are files you sent to John Dyson in 2021, you know John, he serves at the dark side at the moment." "Try the readme, it's mix of your past and present lingo." John Dyson, that name rings a bell, she has briefly communicated with him on the matter of the secret biological weapon, both not working on inside matters.
