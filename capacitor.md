A condenser capsule can withstand high temperatures.           
The woman has no clue how long she spent there,
and dreams of doing honest farmwork,
surrounded by the stench of living death.
Stripped from past and future, she dwells in the ever-present. 
Some time ago the man ripped the skin of the woman's limbs and tore her body into chunks. He put her stolen bones inside the capacitor to keep a small amount of energy. 
Charged and decharged by the value of resistance, what EXACTLY?  

"And ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free." - John 8:32<br>
is carved in stone in the lobby of the Original Headquarters Building.<br>
The man was asked to unearth the truth, but has the truth asked for it?<br> 
His blood frozen from doing duty at the front line<br> 
meanwhile firestorms rage in full view of the world.<br> 
Does the star at the center not deposit enough power? 
The apparent sun is the true sun as seen by an observer on the moon.

A compass is is not needed, a [shadow clock](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3vDsDqIvt5/) will do, maybe one of her bones can tell of which direction the wind is blowing from, he thinks

A fire would be great to get some warmth, black fallout is the worst that can happen, he thinks 

Her bones are well dense and elastic, 
they will oscillate and provoke a superposition of states, he thinks

Waves of longing that show the unintelligble truth
