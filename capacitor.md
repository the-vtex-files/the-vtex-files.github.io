A condenser capsule can withstand high temperatures.                The woman has no clue how long she spent there,
and dreams of doing honest farmwork,
surrounded by the stench of living death.

Some time ago the man ripped the skin of the woman's limbs and tore her body into chunks. He put her stolen bones inside the capacitor to keep a small amount of energy.

is carved in stone in the lobby of the Original Headquarters Building.<br>
The man was asked to unearth the truth, but has the truth asked for it?<br> 
His blood frozen 
from doing duty at the front line of

Her bones are well dense and elastic, he thinks, 
they will oscillate and provoke 
waves of longing,
a superposition of states.

the truth unintelligibel for the man.
