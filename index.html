<b>Glance</b>
This platform should serve as an information pool. 
in form of a game
The future

<b>Mission</b>

Overall objective of the game is to challenge the ideology of linear progress by artistic intervention. 
The future

Starting point and outcomes of the game are neither predetermined nor important, choose from infinite possibilites to discover new, hitherto unknown paths. Exploring own boundaries takes courage and seems already worthwhile but maximum results can be realized collectively.

Inspired by U/Acc and their work on mythpoiesis, success in the game relies on the collaborative creation of myths, or hyperstitions, and the recognition of their political power as a catalyst for societal mobilization.

**Call for participation**<br>
This platform has no direct commercial intentions, but promotes the free flow of information. 

 Slip into the roles of existing characters or invent new ones, go into combat with mythical creatures or appropriate technocapitalism, how to approach complexities on VteX is up to you.<br>
You are encouraged to experiment with language and technology. Every skill you posess will be of surprising use when navigating around VteX, whether it is conflict solving, intuition, or robot slaying, and throughout the game you will be challenged to build upon existing knowledge.<br>
We accept texts of any form, writing, A/V work, image, documentation, performance, etc. Please consider others when choosing a file format.<br>
Turn your desire for system collapse into production and send your proposal (200 words max.) and a short bio to our project admin ca_jaeger@protonmail.com.
