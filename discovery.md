Charlie is driving the single-tracked path to the Center of Agriculture (CA), surrounded by the vast fields of designer wheat and its germane funghi 
rocking softly in the gentle wind. An undisturbed rural idyll,<br>
Indeed, life is spoilt on the far side of the moon.<br>
It is early in the day, the terminator has shifted and moon dust has settled. A long 334.5h work shift lies ahead for Charlie, as a proud member of administrative staff, she is responsible for keeping the crops tidy and their picking before nightfall. The rich harvest is not tantamount with a poor stock market performance, excessively strong winds guarantee a tremendous daily net profit, whenever it's switch-off time for the reaper and crop eradication policy is left to nature. 
The vehicle, 
there are no dead angles 
exemplarily managed orb like VteX, where intelligent self-enmeshing sensor technology sends signals if anything fails to function as usual. 

Tank tracks stop abruptly, a sudden sense of rustling noise puts Charlie's auditory system on alert. Sparse signals that hit her all at once,<br>
Direction finding (DF) proves difficult in prevalent lunar near vacuum conditions. 
```
[divock@localhost ~]$ echo wtf
wtf
```
"Where is this damn noise coming from?"<br>
The armored plate securing her protectoscope slides smoothly to the side, revealing a slick Gundlach rotary periscope assembly. 
Scanning the territory, 'her' territory, which has been carefully calculated and mapped by her. 
Something is moving in the fields, dark blurred spots in an otherwise bleak landscape.
Coming together as a body with unknown agility, frames so boundless to be indefinable by artificial logic.<br>
Anyway, in respect of precision, she has to apply the law of void for vagueness. In the speed of light Charlie recognizes a wolf, but to be more precise, it just resembles a wolf.

Alignment at mid range, reflections of captured light and radio beams
are fed into her directed-energy weapon, which guarantees elimination in a flash. 
The wolf, unbothered, is walking up to her with a determined grin on his face. 

Convulsive adherence to system managment standards, 
 Charlie has only the option of the standard laser, constructed by the company and usually reliable to kill any form that deviates from the citizens of VteX. 
Following the conglomerate's decree, all foreign matter must be eliminated to avoid inconvenience.

"Who the hell are you .. you should be exterminated and burnt to ashes by now."

"Hi, I'm Divock", says the chimeric being "I got a msg for you."<br> 
Charlie recognizes his words, a message, that is information, which can only be interpreted with a sufficient amount of uneconomic noise.<br> 
"How come there is communication between us, you're alien, ?"<br> 

"Things got horribly wrong,<br> 
And you know what? You've only 'made it' here coz of your ambiguous name. Face it, you're a steel case, some wires inside
Still, u're a hybrid, nothing but virtual matter but 
And I'm definitely not alien, especially not to you."

Charlie doesn't get it, 
she's clearly made out of flesh, bones and blood and this bloke is a hallucination, "must be a virus I've catched."

"Still curious about the msg tho, tbh."
Are you sure you can READ it? the interpretation of noise requires plenty of skill. hooman skill.<br>
 
This is a true statement.<br>
"Who is the sender?" 

"Again .. (and Divock is a bit 
It is you, your past you, your language was different then though, lots of noise you were talking."<br>

"Here's the usb. It contains some plain text and a greyscale image, lossless compression, no harmful data, basically."<br>
"What an ancient way to transfer files", she thinks
But why not get the file, going a bit crazy today,
if there's something wrong with it, the system would reject it anyway. 


She opens the .txt file, but doesn't understand. "What does it say, I'm not able to read this."
"That are files you sent to John Dyson in 2019, you know John, he serves at the dark side at the moment." 

John Dyson, that name rings a bell, she has briefly communicated with him on the matter of the secret biological weapon, both not working on inside matters.
