I was driving along the single-tracked path to the Center of Agriculture (CA), surrounded by the vast fields of designer wheat and its germane funghi. It was early in the day, but the terminator has shifted and moon dust has settled, a long 334.5h work shift lied ahead for me. I was a proud member of staff, responsible for keeping the crops tidy and their picking before nightfall. 
The rich harvest was not tantamount with a poor stock market performance, violent storms guaranteed a tremendous daily net profit, whenever it was switch-off time for the reaper and crop eradication policy was left to nature.<br> 
Indeed, life was spoilt on the far side of the moon.

Ears rocked softly in the gentle wind and the vehicle was doing its rounds coherently. I didn't had to worry about missing dead angles as safety took priority on an exemplarily managed orb like VteX, where smart self-enmeshing sensor technology signaled if anything failed to function as usual. The information flow on crop growth progression was kick-ass, as a matter of fact every grain kernel was tracked by the far, wide and steady emission of electromagnetic waves and their backscatter to the receiver.<br>
It was Wed 03 Jul 2020 02:27:45 PM when any acting force between magnetic body and its armature went missing and tank tracks stopped abruptly. Something alien prowled through the fields, territory that has been carefully scanned and mapped by me in real-time.

On the dark side of the moon laser light pulsing set the mode of operation for remote sensing, but this time I couldn't illuminate a target and lost my capability to packetize constituent reflection points into an economically meaningful simulation. Direction finding (DF) can prove difficult in prevalent lunar near vacuum conditions and I had to perform an alternate process common on the bright side. The armored plate securing my protectoscope slid smoothly downwards, revealing a slick Gundlach rotary periscope assembly. 
At first I felt rather sceptical towards the different band of the alternate signal, but the method offered indeed observation of the potential threat, which turned out to be dark blurred spots in an otherwise bleak landscape, merging into a body with bizarre agility. I wished to marvel at this phenomenon for a bit longer as I've never witnessed anything like with event-based -dar.
It was made of infinite boundless frames and escaped any logic but identification was urgent, so I've proceeded with the required law of void for vagueness and instantly recognized a wolf.
(it just resembled a wolf, but that wasn't apparent to me back then)<br>
Finally I was ready for some action.

Reflections of captured radio beams fed my directed-energy weapon (DEW), triggering armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabots (APFSDS) to penetrate the object with kinetic energy. My display indicated a high hit-rate, the wolf however, completely unbothered, was still coming for me with a determined grin on its face. My hands clenched in anger around the railgun and I kept aiming and firing without breathing space nor kill. "Keep calm Charlie", I've tried to reassure myself, "comply with system management standards." Fair enough - I just had the sole option of a standard rifle, constructed by our mighty corporation and usually more than efficacious to eliminate all foreign matter as instructed. The wolf stopped moving and stood now right in front of my muzzle.<br>
"Who the hell are you?" I screamed ".. you should be lacerated flesh by now."

"Hi, I'm Divock", said the chimeric being calmly<br>
"things got horribly wrong, they've cancelled the future and consequently space-time. you won't notice it atm but I got a msg for you - to know where you're at."<br> 
A message, I thought, that is information with an exorbitant amount of uneconomic entropy.<br>
"Sorry, no interest. Anyway, have a good day."<br>
I've decided to pay no longer attention to this nonsense and tried to reboot the whole system.<br>
"Face it, ur just a flat projection of ur former self. Although to me u look like a steel case with some wires in it, LOL<br>
And you know what? You've only 'made it' here coz of your ambiguous name."<br>
Absolutely convinced of hallucinating, I still yelled at him "bullshit, unlike you I'm made of flesh, bones and blood!"<br>
Then he pulled an axe from the back of his trousers and split my skull apart.<br> 
"See, I am REAL. A friend from the past, who just allowed for some sunshine flowing into u."

It felt as if a plug was pulled from a sink and my consciousness drained out. I could watch cerebral matter, bone splinters and body fluids spattering through the air, onto the golden shimmering cereal and his muscular body. Somehow still functioning, I must have lost it or died and entered a parallel universe, either way, there was no other choice than being game for it. Strange how impeccable the mind works after a sudden burst of violence. Just being slaughtered, I didn't want to show any weakness, how would it have benefited the situation anyway? I was naked.<br>
"What message? was that the fucking message? who is the sender?"<br>
"no, listen, the msg contains documents that are beyond any subjective interests. You created them, your past you. Your language was different then though, lots of noise you were talking LOL"<br>
He told me that my memory had been erased without clarifying the circumstances. The longer I was talking to Divock the more my stable reality crumbled, but wasn't I yearning for that ever since being trapped in this nauseating undisturbed rural idyll? Now, trembling with fear for my life and totally freaked out by the imminent revelation, I asked for file transfer.

"I will put the folder on ur harddrive. Are you sure you can READ its contents? the interpretation of noise requires plenty of skill. hooman skill. maybe u have regained some after our encounter"<br>
What the hell was this? A jumble of fragments, lossless compressed cropped images, some of them plain noise, a 'README' with a list of commands ..<br> 
"You encrypted some of the graphics as a precautionary measure, you saw it coming, realizing that the outcome of this state-run project will be catastropic."<br> 
There was also a plain text file named 'John', and after perusing it seemed as I've discussed classified material, about some kind of untraceable plague.<br>
"that is from a conversation with John Dyson in 2019, you know John, he serves on the bright side atm."<br>
John Dyson, that name rang a bell, but I couldn't tell when or where i've heard it before. 

that was last year. 

Divock 
spectre
wind, weather, clouds

wind= allegory for wild hunt
one wolf followed by many wolfs
not alien , they are natives
those creatures double performance : on the one hand fostering on the other destructive. 
rain good, on the other bad
eating the ears, or male /female beget (2)
touch with creature > physical plague
^^during harvest (time of fullness/time that excites every senses)
the spirit /creature is in the last sheaf(b√ºndel)<the one who cuts the last sheaf is throughtout the next year the 'wolf'<portrays it. 
dangerous to touch!
