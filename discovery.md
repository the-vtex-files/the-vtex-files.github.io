I was driving along the single-tracked path to the Center of Agriculture (CA), surrounded by the vast fields of designer wheat and its germane funghi. It was early in the day, but the terminator has shifted and moon dust has settled already, a long 334.5h work shift lied ahead for me. I was a proud member of staff there, responsible for keeping the crops tidy and their picking before nightfall. 
The rich harvest was not tantamount with a poor stock market performance, excessively strong winds guaranteed a tremendous daily net profit, whenever it was switch-off time for the reaper and crop eradication policy was left to nature.<br> 
Indeed, life was spoilt on the far side of the moon.

Ears rocked softly in the gentle wind and the vehicle was doing its rounds coherently. I wasn't afraid of overlooking any dead angles as safety took top priority on an exemplarily managed orb like VteX, 
a consistent emission of signals
where intelligent self-enmeshing sensor technology calculates its environment 
if anything fails to function as usual. 


laser light pulsing and radio

All of a sudden tank tracks stop abruptly, 

Direction finding (DF) still can prove difficult in prevalent lunar near vacuum conditions. 
```
[divock@localhost ~]$ echo wtf
wtf

"Where is this damn noise coming from?"<br>
I had to perform an alternate procedure, 
the armored plate securing my protectoscope slides smoothly to the side, revealing a slick Gundlach rotary periscope assembly, scanning the territory.
I was using LIDAR for remote sensing, 
the territory is constantly carefully calculated and mapped by me.

Something is moving in the fields, dark blurred spots in an otherwise bleak landscape. 
illuminate the target
Coming together as a body with unknown agility, frames so boundless to be indefinable by artificial logic.<br>

Still stunned by this phenomenon

Anyway, in respect of precision, I had to apply the law of void for vagueness. 
In the speed of light I'd recognized a wolf, but to be more precise, it just resembles a wolf.

Alignment at mid range, reflections of captured light and radio beams
are fed into her directed-energy weapon, which guarantees elimination in a flash. 
The wolf, unbothered, was walking up to me with a determined grin on his face. 
I haven't been in a critical situation like this before, 
keep calm charlie i said to myself, nothing will happen if I 
with system managment standards, 
I kept aiming and firing, 
I only had the option of the standar (), constructed by the company and usually reliable to kill any form that deviates from the citizens of VteX. 
Following the conglomerate's decree, all foreign matter must be eliminated to avoid inconvenience.

"Who the hell are you .. you should be exterminated and burnt to ashes by now."

"Hi, I'm Divock", said the chimeric being "I got a msg for you."<br> 
I was totally recognizing his words, a message, that is information, which can only be interpreted with a sufficient amount of uneconomic noise.<br> 
"How come there is communication between us, you're obviously alien, ?"

"Things got horribly wrong,<br> 
And you know what? You've only 'made it' here coz of your ambiguous name. Face it, you're a steel case, some wires and ceramics inside
Still, u're a hybrid, nothing but virtual matter but 
And I'm definitely not alien, especially not to you."

I didn't get it back then and naively believed I'm made out of flesh, bones and blood, was my experience caused by trauma? 
I didn't know how to act, so I treated the bloke and scenario as a hallucination, "must be a virus I've catched."

"Still curious about the msg tho, tbh."
Are you sure you can READ it? the interpretation of noise requires plenty of skill. hooman skill.<br>
 
This is a true statement.<br>
"Who is the sender?" 

"Again .. (and Divock is a bit 
It is you, your past you, your language was different then though, lots of noise you were talking."<br>

"Here's the usb. It contains some plain text and a greyscale image, lossless compression, no harmful data, basically."<br>
"What an ancient way to transfer files", I thought, "but why not get the files, 
I could go a bit crazy today in this otherwise undisturbed rural idyll, if there's something wrong with them, the system would reject them anyway."


She opens the .txt file, but doesn't understand. "What does it say, I'm not able to read this."
"That are files you sent to John Dyson in 2019, you know John, he serves at the dark side at the moment." 

John Dyson, that name rings a bell, she has briefly communicated with him on the matter of the secret biological weapon, both not working on inside matters.
