I was driving along the single-tracked path to the Center of Agriculture (CA), surrounded by the vast fields of designer wheat and its germane funghi. It was early in the day, but the terminator has shifted and moon dust has settled, a long 334.5h work shift lied ahead for me. I was a proud member of staff, responsible for keeping the crops tidy and their picking before nightfall. 
The rich harvest was not tantamount with a poor stock market performance, violent storms guaranteed a tremendous daily net profit, whenever it was switch-off time for the reaper and crop eradication policy was left to nature.<br> 
Indeed, life was spoilt on the far side of the moon.

Ears rocked softly in the gentle wind and the vehicle was doing its rounds coherently. I didn't had to worry about missing any dead angles as safety took priority on an exemplarily managed orb like VteX, where smart self-enmeshing sensor technology signaled if anything failed to function as usual. The information flow on crop growth progression was kick-ass, as a matter of fact every grain kernel was tracked by the far, wide and steady emission of electromagnetic waves, their backscatter and return to the receiver.

It was Wed 03 Jul 2020 02:27:45 PM when any acting force between magnetic body and its armature went missing and tank tracks stopped abruptly. Something alien prowled through the fields,<br>
territory that was carefully scanned, tracked and mapped by me in real-time.

On the dark side of the moon laser light pulsing set the mode of operation for remote sensing, but this time I couldn't illuminate a target and lost the capaticity to packetize constituent reflection points into an economically meaningful simulation. Direction finding (DF) can prove difficult in prevalent lunar near vacuum conditions<br>
and I had to perform an alternate process common on the bright side.

The armored plate securing my protectoscope slid smoothly to the side, revealing a slick Gundlach rotary periscope assembly.
The potential threat turned out to be dark blurred spots in an otherwise bleak landscape, merging into a body with bizarre agility. Frames appeared 

boundless to be definable by artificial logic.<br>

In respect of precision I proceeded with the law of void for vagueness although 
I wished I could marvel at
this phenomenon
for some time longer
, as I've never witnessed anything like it with event-based -dar before, but identification was urgent.
within the speed of light I've recognized a wolf
But to be more precise, it just resembled a wolf .. but this 

Alignment at close range, 
reflections of captured radio beams that fed my directed-energy weapon (DEW) 
and triggered high velocity projectiles that assured annihilation in a flash.<br>
The wolf, unbothered still, was walking up to me with a determined grin on his face. 
I've never been in a clusterfuck like this before, "Keep calm Charlie",
I said to myself, "comply with system management standards."

I kept aiming and firing without kill
  and I only had the option of the standard weapon, constructed by the company and usually more than reliable to eliminate all alien matter

The wolf stopped at 
"Who the hell are you .. you should've met god and burnt to ashes by now."

"Hi, I'm Divock", said the chimeric being "I got a msg for you."<br> 
I was recognizing his words, a message, that is information, which can only be interpreted with a sufficient amount of uneconomic noise.<br> 
"Things got horribly wrong, they've cancelled time.<br> 
Face it, you're just a steel case
And you know what? You've only 'made it' here coz of your ambiguous name. 
And I'm definitely not alien, especially not to you"

flesh, bones and blood,

I treated the bloke and scenario as a hallucination, "must be a virus I've catched."
But the longer I've talked to him, my stable reality crumbled, 
am I losing it?

"How come there is communication between us, you're obviously alien?"
"Still curious about the msg tho, tbh."
Are you sure you can READ it? the interpretation of noise requires plenty of skill. hooman skill.<br>
 
"Who is the sender?" 

"It is you, your past you, your language was different then though, lots of noise you were talking."<br>

"Here's the usb. It contains some plain text and a greyscale image, lossless compression, no harmful data, basically."<br>
This is a true statement.<br>
"What an ancient way to transfer files", I thought, "but why not get them, I could go a bit crazy today in this otherwise undisturbed rural idyll, if there's something wrong with them, the system would reject them anyway."

I've opened a file named "John",  
which was copied on the ***
"That are files you sent to John Dyson in 2019, you know John, he serves at the dark side at the moment." 

John Dyson, that name rings a bell, she has briefly communicated with him on the matter of the secret biological weapon, both not working on inside matters.
