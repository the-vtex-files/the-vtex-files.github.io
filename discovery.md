Charlie is driving the single-tracked path to the Center of Agriculture (CA), surrounded by the vast fields of designer wheat and its germane funghi 
rocking softly in the gentle wind. An undisturbed rural idyll,<br>
Indeed, life is spoilt on the far side of the moon.<br>
It is early in the day, the terminator has shifted and moon dust has settled. A long 334.5h work shift lies ahead for Charlie, as a proud member of administrative staff, she is responsible for keeping the crops tidy and their picking before nightfall. The rich harvest is not tantamount with a poor stock market performance, excessively strong winds guarantee a tremendous daily net profit, whenever it's switch-off time for the reaper and crop eradication policy is left to nature. 

The vehicle's dead angle monitoring is off, no need, nor time for that on an exemplarily managed orb like VteX, intelligent self-enmeshing sensor technology scans the territory and sends signals if anything fails to function as usual. This once vexing rustling noise is impinging Charlie's auditory system, sparse and all at once, but her existing potential cannot be utilized, vision adjustment proves difficult in prevalent lunar near vacuum conditions. 
```
[divock@localhost ~]$ echo wtf
wtf

Something is moving in the fields - that doesn't ease the critical situation - dark blurred spots in an otherwise bleak landscape, coming together as a body with unknown agility, boundless frames indefinable by artificial logic. Void for vagueness is law and a wolf is recognized in the speed of light, to be more precise, it resembles a wolf with humanlike features but it does not play any role in this valuation, 

Following the conglomerate's decree, all foreign matter must be eliminated to avoid inconvenience.
Elimination in a flash - but the wolfr untouched is walking up to her,  
Convulsive adherence to command 

but Charlie has only the option of the standard laser, constructed by the company and usually reliable to kill any form that deviates from the citizens of VteX. 

"I don't understand .. who are you .. you should be annihilated and burnt to ashes."

"Hi, I'm Divock", says the chimeric being "I got a msg for you." <br>
Charlie recognizes his words, a message, that is information, which can only be interpreted with a sufficient amount of uneconomic noise.<br>
"You're not a part of the system, you don't have the app installed, so you're not able to send any message to me. Still curious tho, tbh."<br> 
"What format is it? I can only read files with common standard .eXTs"

"Are you sure you can READ it?<br>
I don't say that you wouldn't do a good job as an interpreter but hasn't VteX fully switched to compiling nowadays? 
And the interpretation of noise requires plenty of skill. hooman skill.<br>
However it's some plain text and greyscale imagery, lossless compression, no harmful data, basically. The usb is formatted as FAT32 architecture can be navigated by a system like yours. 

This is a true statement.<br>
"Who is the sender?" Usually all notifications -without exception- pass through the central server. 

"It is you, your past you, your language was different then though, lots of noise you were talking.<br>
And you know what? You've only 'made it' here because of your ambiguous name."

"I'm a glitch in time, virtual matter, just like you." 
Charlie doesn't get it, she's clearly made out of flesh, bones and blood and this bloke is a hallucination, must be a virus she catched. 
But why not get the file, going a bit crazy today,
if there's something wrong with it, the system would reject it anyway. 

 "Here's the usb." What an ancient way to transfer files, she thinks, while the folder pops up immediately, containing a txt file, a .png and readme.md. It's not an application, she opens the file, but doesn't understand. "What does it say, I'm not able to read this."
"That's are files you sent to John Dyson in 2019, you know John, he serves at the dark side at the moment." "Try the readme, it's mix of your past and present lingo." John Dyson, that name rings a bell, she has briefly communicated with him on the matter of the secret biological weapon, both not working on inside matters.
