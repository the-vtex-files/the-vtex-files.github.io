I was driving along the single-tracked path to the Center of Agriculture (CA), surrounded by the vast fields of designer wheat and its germane funghi. It was early in the day, but the terminator has shifted and moon dust has settled, a long 334.5h work shift lied ahead for me. I was a proud member of staff, responsible for keeping the crops tidy and their picking before nightfall. 
The rich harvest was not tantamount with a poor stock market performance, violent storms guaranteed a tremendous daily net profit, whenever it was switch-off time for the reaper and crop eradication policy was left to nature.<br> 
Indeed, life was spoilt on the far side of the moon.

Ears rocked softly in the gentle wind and the vehicle was doing its rounds coherently. I didn't had to worry about missing dead angles as safety took priority on an exemplarily managed orb like VteX, where smart self-enmeshing sensor technology signaled if anything failed to function as usual. The information flow on crop growth progression was kick-ass, as a matter of fact every grain kernel was tracked by the far, wide and steady emission of electromagnetic waves, their backscatter and return to the receiver.<br>
It was Wed 03 Jul 2020 02:27:45 PM when any acting force between magnetic body and its armature went missing and tank tracks stopped abruptly. Something alien prowled through the fields,
territory that was carefully scanned, tracked and mapped by me in real-time.

On the dark side of the moon laser light pulsing set the mode of operation for remote sensing, but this time I couldn't illuminate a target and lost my capability to packetize constituent reflection points into an economically meaningful simulation. Direction finding (DF) can prove difficult in prevalent lunar near vacuum conditions and I had to perform an alternate process common on the bright side.

The armored plate securing my protectoscope slid smoothly to the side, revealing a slick Gundlach rotary periscope assembly.
The potential threat turned out to be dark blurred spots in an otherwise bleak landscape, merging into a body with bizarre agility. 
I wished to marvel at this phenomenon for some time longer as I've never witnessed anything like that with event-based -dar, but identification was urgent.

It was made of infinite boundless frames and escaped any logic.
In respect of precision I proceeded with the law of void for vagueness, 
 within the speed of light 
I've recognized a wolf,  
but it just resembled a wolf .. just not apparent to me. 

Reflections of captured radio beams fed my directed-energy weapon (DEW) and triggered high velocity projectiles that assured annihilation in a flash.
The wolf, unbothered still, was walking up to me with a determined grin on his face. 

I couldn't take a breather, "Keep calm Charlie",
I said to myself, "comply with system management standards."

I kept aiming and firing without kill, 
and just had the option of a standard weapon
constructed by the company and usually more than reliable to eliminate all foreign matter as instructed.

The wolf just stood in front of me. 
"Who the hell are you .. you should be burnt to ashes by now."

"Hi, I'm Divock", said the chimeric being calmly 

"Things got horribly wrong, they've cancelled space-time. 

Face it, you're 
just a steel case with some wires in it
flat, a projection of ur former self
reality

However, I am real, a friend from the past. 

And you know what? You've only 'made it' here coz of your ambiguous name. 

"I got a msg for you."<br> 
I was recognizing his words, a message, that is information, which can only be interpreted with a sufficient amount of uneconomic noise.<br> 
I was hallucinating, "must be a virus I've catched."
Surely I was made of 
flesh, bones and blood,
There was no choice other to be game for it. 
"Still curious about the msg tho, tbh."
"Why not get them", I thought, "I could go a bit crazy today in this otherwise undisturbed rural idyll, if there's something wrong with them, the system would reject them anyway."
"Who is the sender?" 

"It is you, your past you, your language was different then though, lots of noise you were talking."<br>

"That are files you sent to John Dyson in 2019, you know John, he serves at the dark side at the moment." 
John Dyson, that name rings a bell, she has briefly communicated with him on the matter of the secret biological weapon, both not working on inside matters.
Are you sure you can READ it? the interpretation of noise requires plenty of skill. hooman skill.<br>

But the longer I've talked to him, my stable reality crumbled, 
am I losing it?

 "It contains some plain text and  greyscale images lossless compression, no harmful data, basically."<br>
This is a true statement.<br>


The folder contained images that didn't make any sense. 


a file named "John", which was copied on the ***
with scrambled text

and identity.check.
