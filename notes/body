becoming a formless form?
the act of consolidation should be the second last before annihilation. 
survival thus requires a last salutary gesture of inhibition (Hemmung)

Lispector: The Passion According to G.H.:
'not have the strenght to stay disorganized'
'let me at least have the courage to let that form form by itself'
'let me have the great courage to resist the temptation to invent a form'
If 'foresight closes the world', then we need to suicideally persist in te closure of nowness, >>the disfunction of two points trying to inhabit a same space (now and future)

All organisms creat experimental rules to simplify their world. (but don't do that on purpose?)
Habits of perception organize the environment .. >stable reality. Preventing the stricture of the real from loosening at every instance.
Inhibiton is necessary in order to function. 
Every fixity, every identity is an inhibiton of the continuous production of natures.
The second body is a post-self body facing a catastrophic openness, the nightmarish gulf of the unknown.
'alterity, not identity, is the default state in Amazonia'
Negarestani: 'abducting the outside'
Massumi: 'will and consciousness are subtractive'
every actualization is a closure .. 'a movement away from the future' (coz it means staying still?)

Popa argues that practicing different habits, a 'chronically unstable body' could be a world of awesome simplicity. (like a tick? but tick just waiting/Uexk√ºll)

todays economics: 'scarcity of the possible' 'underdeveloped everyday life'. The vital coincides with the economical, consumption becomes marketing and being becomes a job.
