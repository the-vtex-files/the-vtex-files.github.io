(1) diverse sorts of time and space, eg. phenomenological, geological times; space of body, space of global economy.
space dependent on time >diff ways how time is conceived, measured, changed.
(2)time and space appear natural to people, as lying outside of society and beyond human control. 

(3) the psychology of spatial sensation, perception, and cognition, a topic wellexplored by behavioral geographers (Couclelis adn Golledge 1983)
he https://www.iep.utm.edu/reichenb/ said: "Time has generally been considered as an ordering schema similar to, but simpler than, that of space, simpler because it has only one dimension."

Poincare

(14)time and space debate between Newton and Leibniz. Newton (is he natural phil?): time and space are abstract, exist and are absolute and REAL, independent of their measurement, or of whatever they contained (cultural) or how measured.
Leibniz: S-T is relational, only in reference to specific frames of interpretation. eg. distance is the space between two or more objects situated in space. Space and time, therefore, had no independent existence, but were derivative of how we measured them. 
^both are correct, so what??
