What shell do I have: echo $SHELL
doesn't need .sh extension, but recommended??

script executable for current user: chmod u+x ~/somecrazyfolder/script1 BUT
if I create a bin folder in home directory, then I don't have to use the ./ prefix to run it. 

script names shouldn't conflict with names of commands, thus check:
which [command] 

1.    Every script should being with “#!/bin/bash”
      Every new line is a new command
      Comment lines start with a #
      Commands are surrounded by ()

New Line = New Command
how to avoid the prob? through indent??
REMEMBER: this applies also to comment # lines !
