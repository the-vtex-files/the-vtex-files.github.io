Karl Lamprecht: Methodenstreit der Geschichtswissenschaft.
is into looking at history in a cultural context instead of 'statistical'?
"it is not so important to show how it actually was, but how it became."
anti-whig history; instead importance of milieu and economics, rather than politics /individual (white men)
historical materialism? <what does that mean?
