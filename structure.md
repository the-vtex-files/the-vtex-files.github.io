**i. structure** Satellites in the sky, they form
the outer peripheral points of the central nervous system accurately positioned Artificial moons elevated from territory
observe earthly life indifferently, receiving and transmitting signals within
A structure built by those infected by the alien pathogen (Greek: πάθος pathos "suffering,
passion" and -γενής -genēs "producer of")

Entangled in the inextricable void
tied up with constructing
constant parallels of progress and decay
The global positioning system determines the spacetime coordinates of
past and future.

While Meaning sounds in nothing
simultaneously everywhere and nowhere,
mass hallucination is
the compression of time to mine virtual space.
Meanwhile the plasmic inversion of space and time,
where sound travels faster than light
buried truth in a- geological inner-time.
