**i. structure** Satellites in the sky, they form<br>
the outer peripheral points of the central nervous system<br>
accurately positioned Artificial moons elevated from territory<br>
observe earthly life indifferently, receiving and transmitting signals within<br>
A structure built by those infected by the alien pathogen (Greek: πάθος pathos "suffering,<br>
passion" and -γενής -genēs "producer of")

Entangled in the inextricable void<br>
tied up with constructing<br>
constant parallels of progress and decay<br>
The global positioning system determines the spacetime coordinates of
past and future.<br>

While Meaning sounds in nothing<br>
simultaneously everywhere and nowhere,<br>
mass hallucination is<br>
the compression of time to mine virtual space.<br>
Meanwhile the plasmic inversion of space and time,<br>
where sound travels faster than light<br>f
buried truth in a- geological inner-time.
