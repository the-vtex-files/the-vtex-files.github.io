**_The VteX Files_** is an interactive RPG /browser game. The background of the story revolves around the strange events on the fictional moon *VteX*, layered with facts from the history of science and technology, aiming towards a clearer vision of reality in an ever complex world. 

The concept of the project is *the virus*, and players can explore its function as a political agent within society and culture and test its capabilities in softening or destabilizing entrenched frontiers. Virulence is vital noise that can jam artificial intelligence (AI), which has its roots in formal reasoning /modernity and has since infested culture globally to become an inextricable network of infinite machinic assemblies. Consequential imminent dangers to society get merely patched up with intrasystem mechanistic solutions, instead of using common sense and taking action. Governmental agencies and corporations adding falsified, biased descriptions to a flood of data, thus framing social constructs, which are liable for injustice and racism. Noise reduction for the sake of control and profit results in a decline of meaning or any valuable exchange, as observed in current post-truth politics, a fertile ground for a climate of hate. 

Aim is fostering critical thinking, autonomous responsible action. 
Critical engagement with technology, 
to experiment and discover
