Overall mission of the game is the active creation of a future in the present. 
is to challenge the ideology of linear progress by artistic interpretation and to discover and enter new, unknown, infinite paths.

It is inspired by the collaborative creation of myths. 
by and for the people to make it happen. 
As everyone is given a voice and access to add or modify, myths embody lived experience and are crystallized democracy.
Having a voice implies constant work, the building of knowledge, learning to resolve conflicts and sharpening intuition and phrasing are most important in the dire current political climate, characterized by an out of control capitalism, hate speech and division.
Utopias are institutionalized constructs that are severed from cultural and economic realities and a whitewash of a future that will never happen.
myth function as a political catalyst within society and culture and test its capabilities in softening or destabilizing entrenched frontiers. 
Myths are vital noise that can jam artificial intelligence (AI), which has its roots in formal reasoning and has since infested culture globally.

Governmental agencies and corporations adding falsified, biased descriptions to a flood of data, thus framing social constructs, which are liable for injustice and racism. Noise reduction for the sake of control and profit results in a decline of meaning or any valuable exchange, as observed in current post-truth politics, a fertile ground for a climate of hate.
