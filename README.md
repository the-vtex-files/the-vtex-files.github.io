**The VteX Files** is an experimental RPG /browser game in form of collective myth creation, consisting of random texts assembled with factual episodes from the history of science & technology and current affairs.creating a whole 

It comes without a preconceived and rigid storyline, the futile task of engineering a future is handed over to the forces of chaos, which allow for authentic outcomes

Hosted on github, a platform, that allows for free exchange of ideas 
and their subsequent integration into live-action. 

Overall mission of the game is the active shaping of a future in the present. 
and to challenge the ideology of linear progress by artistic interpretation and to discover and enter new, unknown, infinite paths. 

a training to combine intellect and senses
 by bluring fact and fiction 
 the aim towards a clearer vision of reality in an ever complex, entangled world. 

The game is inspired by the process of myths 
by and for the people to make it happen. 
As everyone is given a voice and access to add or modify, myths embody lived experience and are crystallized democracy.
Having a voice implies constant work, the building of knowledge, learning to resolve conflicts and sharpening intuition and phrasing are most important in the dire current political climate, characterized by an out of control capitalism, hate speech and division.
Utopias are institutionalized constructs that are severed from cultural and economic realities and a whitewash of a future that will never happen.
myth function as a political catalyst within society and culture and test its capabilities in softening or destabilizing entrenched frontiers. 
Myths are vital noise that can jam artificial intelligence (AI), which has its roots in formal reasoning and has since infested culture globally.
speculative fiction (mythopoiesis)

Governmental agencies and corporations adding falsified, biased descriptions to a flood of data, thus framing social constructs, which are liable for injustice and racism. Noise reduction for the sake of control and profit results in a decline of meaning or any valuable exchange, as observed in current post-truth politics, a fertile ground for a climate of hate.
