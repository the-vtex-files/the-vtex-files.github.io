**The VteX Files** is an experimental RPG /browser game, 
comprising random texts

that blur fact and fiction
to combine ones intellect and senses
 the aim towards a clearer vision of reality in an ever complex, entangled world.

which revolves around the strange events on moon Vtex assembled with real, current or historical episodes of science and technology  
Objective of the game is to challenge the ideology of linear progress by artistic production and to discover and enter yet unknown paths. 

The game is inspired by the process of collective myth-making, or [mythopoesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythopoeia). 
 Myths, or speculative fiction are by and for the people, or speculative fiction 
Contrary to utopias,which are institutionalized constructs that are severed from cultural and economic realities and a whitewash of a future that will never happen.
The RPG game format allows
to come without a preconceived storyline, the futile task of engineering a future is handed over to the forces of chaos, which allow for authentic outcomes and creating a whole.


As everyone is given a voice and access to add or modify, myths embody individual lived experience 
crystalize democracy
Having a voice however implies constant work, the building of knowledge, learning to resolve conflicts and sharpening intuition and phrasing are most important in the dire current political climate, characterized by an out of control capitalism, hate speech and division.
Myth function as a political catalyst to mobilize society  

The project is hosted on github and intended as a platform for a free and decentralized exchange of ideas. 

**Open Call**<br>
Imagine you are on moon VteX, a place strange yet familiar to yours.
no future
Together with your fellow inhabitants you are exposed to events of horror 
and turn your desire for the collapse of the system into production.
Join for a  mutual quest for a new homeland.

You are encouraged to experiment with language and technology, to improvise and to interact. The course of the game is mediated through individual and joint action
calling for responsibility and kindness.

You can slip into the roles of existing characters, or invent new ones,
 and model actualities on moon VteX.    

Reenacting and appropriating present conditions might be one way to approach complexities on VteX.
