**The VteX Files** is an experimental action RPG, 
 blurring fact and fiction 
aiming towards a broader perspective of reality. 

Strange events happening on moon VteX, a rather hostile environment for the human species. In the process, this tale of out-of-control capitalism, inter-dimensional surveillance and robot slaying becomes strangely and poignantly relatable. 

texts are assembled with episodes from the history of science & technology or current affairs.
fit together as a whole
Objective of the game is to challenge the ideology of linear progress by artistic intervention and to discover and enter new, hitherto unknown paths. 
getting rid self-centered, 

The game is inspired by the process of collaborative myth-making, or [mythopoesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythopoeia). 
Contrary to utopias, which are instutionalized constructs, severed from cultural and economic realities and a whitewash of a future that will never happen.
 myths, are by and for the people. 

As everyone is given a voice and access to add or modify, myths embody individual lived experience and crystalized democracy. 
Having a voice however implies constant work, the building of knowledge, learning to resolve conflicts and sharpening intuition and phrasing are most important in the dire current political climate, characterized by an out of control capitalism, hate speech and division.

The format of RPG 
implies improvisation and interaction
the futile task of engineering a future is handed over to the forces of chaos, which allow for authentic outcomes 

Myth function as a political catalyst to mobilize society  

The project is hosted on github and intended as a platform for a free and decentralized exchange of ideas. Not organized, which means many choices, lots of entropy randomized. 

**Rules**
Based on [Nomic](), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic)ithe course of the game is mediated through individual and joint action. 
starting point is to win 100 points
autonomous
Every move means change of direction,
 existing VteX files are immutable (Class A rule), can be changed(are consitutional)or it is a principle? /standard Note 3
and if you want to kill your fellow team member and play with their bones, fine it is roleplay, howevee every last rule of the game can change in the the course of play, the players may feel that they are playing a "different game" after a few rounds than when they sat down(4)
players are the rule and change themselves?
mutable /immutable , >transmuted
101 rule important
