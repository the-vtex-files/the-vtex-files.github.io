**The VteX Files** is an experimental action RPG set on moon VteX, a rather hostile environment, where players face an abyss full of horrors. In the process, this tale of out-of-control capitalism, inter-dimensional surveillance and space-time distortion becomes strangely and poignantly relatable.

Slip into the roles of existing -agonists, 

main characters archetypes, Charlie Hanson and John Dyson, employees in the farming and military sector 
Or invent new ones,
and ngage with the adventures, go into combat with mythical creatures or appropriate technocapitalism, how to approach complexities on VteX is up to you.

leave it to the forces of chaos 
the futile task of engineering 
doesnt mean no skills
every skill you posess will be of surprising use when navigating around VteX, whether it is conflict solving, intuition, or robot slaying, and throughout the game you will be challenged to build upon existing knowledge.<br>

Put your skills and sanity to the test 
tarting point and outcomes of the game are neither predetermined nor important, choose from infinite possibilites to discover new, hitherto unknown paths.
Turn your desire for system collapse into gaming.
