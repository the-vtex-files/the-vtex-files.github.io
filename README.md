**The VteX Files** is an experimental RPG /browser game 
where strange episodes on moon Vtex alternate with real current or historical events of science & technology or politics. 

Random texts that blur fact and fiction.



Mission of the game is to challenge the ideology of linear progress by artistic interpretation and to discover and enter yet unknown, infinite paths. 
to combine ones intellect and senses
 the aim towards a clearer vision of reality in an ever complex, entangled world.

The game is inspired by the process of collective myth-making, or 
[mythopoesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythopoeia) 
 
Contrary to utopias,which are institutionalized constructs that are severed from cultural and economic realities and a whitewash of a future that will never happen.
The RPG game format allows
to come without a preconceived storyline, the futile task of engineering a future is handed over to the forces of chaos, which allow for authentic outcomes and creating a whole.

Myths are by and for the people 
to actively shape a future in the present. 
peculative fiction)

As everyone is given a voice and access to add or modify, myths embody lived experience and are crystallized democracy.

Having a voice implies constant work, the building of knowledge, learning to resolve conflicts and sharpening intuition and phrasing are most important in the dire current political climate, characterized by an out of control capitalism, hate speech and division.

Myth function as a political catalyst within society and culture and test its capabilities in softening or destabilizing entrenched frontiers. 
Myths are vital noise that can jam artificial intelligence (AI), which has its roots in formal reasoning and has since infested culture globally.
speculative fiction (mythopoiesis)

Governmental agencies and corporations adding falsified, biased descriptions to a flood of data, thus framing social constructs, which are liable for injustice and racism. Noise reduction for the sake of control and profit results in a decline of meaning or any valuable exchange, as observed in current post-truth politics, a fertile ground for a climate of hate. 

The project is hosted on github and intended as a platform for a free and decentralized exchange of ideas.

**Open Call**<br>
Imagine you are on moon VteX, a place strange yet familiar
Together with your fellow inhabitants you are exposed to events of horror 
and have a desire and make efforts with the system to collapse. 
Join them in their mutual quest for a new homeland!

Gamers are encouraged to experiment with language and technology, to improvise and to interact.
They can slip into the roles of existing characters, or invent new ones, and model actualities on moon VteX.    
Reenacting and exaggerating present conditions might be one way to approach complexities on VteX.
The game doesn't come with clear rules and is in principle mediated through individual and joint action
calling for responsibility and kindness.
