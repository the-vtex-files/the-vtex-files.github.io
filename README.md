**The VteX Files** is an experimental action RPG set on moon VteX, a rather hostile environment, where players face an abyss full of horrors. In the process, this tale of out-of-control capitalism, inter-dimensional surveillance and space-time distortion becomes strangely and poignantly relatable.
Descriptions and dialogue are blurred with real events, posing the additional difficulty to draw a clear line between fact and fiction, with the intended effect to consider matters from various angles, which all have to be taken into account. 
Overall objective of the game is to challenge the ideology of linear progress by artistic intervention. Starting point and outcomes of the game are neither predetermined nor important, choose from infinite possibilites to discover new, hitherto unknown paths. Exploring own boundaries takes courage and seems already worthwhile but maximum results can be realized collectively.
Inspired by U/Acc and their work on mythpoiesis, success in the game relies on the collaborative creation of myths, or hyperstitions, and the recognition of their political power as a catalyst for societal mobilization.

**The VteX Files** is crypto-gaming distributed via git, which allows for a free and decentralized peer-to-peer exchange of ideas. The source of the game (master branch) with its entiry history can be downloaded (cloned) on participants local drives and is basically tamper-proof.<br>
**Rules** (beta) 
+ every commit means almost instant change to the rules of the game, linking its past and present to form chronological chains, that point towards a future push
+ artistic tokens are non-fungible tokens (NFT)
+ once pushed to the master branch, changes are permantly added. They are immutable and have to be carried forward to the next merge
+ art is proof-of-work (PoW), every artist is a miner
+ do what you have to do, after all it is roleplay but be considerate

Put your skills and sanity to the test by handing over the futile task of engineering a future to the forces of chaos! Slip into the roles of existing characters or invent new ones, go into combat with mythical creatures or appropriate technocapitalism, how to approach complexities on VteX is up to you.<br>
You are encouraged to experiment with language and technology. Every skill you posess will be of surprising use when navigating around VteX, whether it is conflict solving, intuition, or robot slaying, and throughout the game you will be challenged to build upon existing knowledge.<br>
We accept texts of any form, writing, A/V work, image, documentation, performance, etc. Please consider others when choosing a file format.<br>
