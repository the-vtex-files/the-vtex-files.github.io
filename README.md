**The VteX Files** is an experimental action RPG set on moon VteX, a rather hostile environment, where players face an abyss full of horrors. In the process, this tale of out-of-control capitalism, inter-dimensional surveillance and space-time distortion becomes strangely and poignantly relatable. The difficulty to draw a clear line between fact and fiction, as descriptions and dialogue are blurred with real events, aims at comprehending the world as a whole.
Overall objective of the game is to challenge the ideology of linear progress by artistic intervention. Outcomes of the game are neither predetermined nor important, choose from infinite possibilites to discover new, hitherto unknown paths.
 Exploring your own boundaries seems already worthwhile but maximum results can be realized collectively.<br>
Inspired by U/Acc and their work on mythpoiesis, success in the game relies on collaborative myth-making and the realization of the political potency of myths, or hyperstitions, which are deeply rooted in society and function as a catalyst for mobilization.
The futile task of engineering a future is handed over to the forces of chaos, 

The VteX Files is organized via git, which allows for a free and decentralized peer-to-peer exchange of ideas. 
The source of the game and its entiry history are basically tamper-proof, 
as can be cloned on participants local drives.
**Rules** (beta) are derived from blockchain technology

+ every commit means almost immediate change
pushing forward the future in form of a chronological chain 

+ once pushed to the master branch, changes are permantly added. They are immutable and have to be carried forward to the next merge.

+ people may fork from the master branch and either stay in their own game or open a pull request
+  after all it is roleplay, but be noble irl

**Open Call**<br>
Slip into the roles of existing characters or invent new ones, go into combat with mythical creatures or appropriate technocapitalism, how to approach complexities on VteX is up to you. 
It takes courage to be in the driving seat and your sanity will be put to the test, 
collaboration is essential for survival. 
 

You will be part to add or modify, however implies constant work, the building of knowledge, learning to resolve conflicts and sharpening intuition.
