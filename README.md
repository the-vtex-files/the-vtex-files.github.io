**The VteX Files** is an experimental action RPG set on moon VteX, a rather hostile environment, where players face an abyss full of horrors. In the process, this tale of out-of-control capitalism, inter-dimensional surveillance and space-time distortion becomes strangely and poignantly relatable. 
The difficulty to draw a clear line between fact and fiction, as descriptions and dialogue are blurred with real events, in many cases from the history of science & technology, aims at comprehending the world as a whole.
Overall objective of the game is to challenge the ideology of linear progress by artistic intervention. Outcomes of the game are neither predetermined nor important, choose from infinite possibilites to discover new, hitherto unknown paths. It takes courage to diverge from beaten tracks but you are in the driving seat and decide what comes next. 
Exploring the boundaries of what is possible seems already worthwhile but maximum results can be realized collectively.<br>
Inspired by U/Acc and their work on mythpoiesis, success in the game relies on collaborative myth-making and the recognition of the political potency of myths, which are deeply rooted in society and function as a catalyst for real change and mobilization.

Myths, or hyperstitions stand in stark contrast to utopias, 
institutionalized constructs, severed from cultural and economic realities, and can only provide an improved version of the present.

the futile task of engineering a future is handed over to the forces of chaos,

In the game everyone is given a voice and access to add or modify, Having a voice however implies constant work, the building of knowledge, learning to resolve conflicts and sharpening intuition. Throughout the game you are challenged to do so and encouraged to experiment with language and technology.


The VteX Files is organized via git, which allows for a free and decentralized peer-to-peer exchange of ideas and rules are adopted from blockchain technology.
The game and its entiry history is basically tamper-proof, as can be cloned on each participants local drive.

**Rules**
+ every push means change through individual and joint action
+ once on the master branch, changes are permantly added and immutable and have to be carried forward to the next merge
+ once a pull request is opened, the majority decides on merging
+ people may fork from the master branch and start their own game, the longest chain wins + timestamped and hashed by commits
+ it is roleplay, but be kind irl
