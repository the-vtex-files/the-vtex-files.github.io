**_The VteX Files_** is an interactive RPG /browser game, which aims towards a clearer vision of reality in an ever complex world. 
It revolves around the strange events on the fictional moon *VteX*, assembled with factual episodes from the history of science & technology and current affairs. 

The concept of the game is *the virus*, and players can explore its function as a political agent within society and culture and test its capabilities in softening or destabilizing entrenched frontiers. Virulence is vital noise that can jam artificial intelligence (AI), which has its roots in formal reasoning and has since infested culture globally.
Governmental agencies and corporations adding falsified, biased descriptions to a flood of data, thus framing social constructs, which are liable for injustice and racism. Noise reduction for the sake of control and profit results in a decline of meaning or any valuable exchange, as observed in current post-truth politics, a fertile ground for a climate of hate. 

Objective of the project is to challenge the ideology of progress by artistic interpretation and to discover and enter new, unknown paths. Players are encouraged
to experiment with language and technology, both in the virtual and actual world, forming a free exchange of ideas and their subsequent integration into live-action.
