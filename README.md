**The VteX Files** is an experimental RPG

Environment is the fictional moon VteX 

the strange events on moon VteX are assembled with factual, 
current political situation
from the history of science & technology  
blur fact and fiction

Objective of the game is to challenge the ideology of linear progress by artistic intervention and to discover and enter new, hitherto unknown paths. 
not organized, many choices, lots of entropy, randomized
every move means change of direction, 

skills needed: to combine ones intellect and senses
with the aim towards a broader perspective of reality in an ever complex, entangled world.
fit together as a whole
The format of RPG 
implies improvisation and interaction
the futile task of engineering a future is handed over to the forces of chaos, which allow for authentic outcomes 

The game is inspired by the process of collective myth-making, or [mythopoesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythopoeia). 
Contrary to utopias,
constructs that are severed from cultural and economic realities and a whitewash of a future that will never happen.
 myths, on the other hand  are by and for the people

As everyone is given a voice and access to add or modify, myths embody individual lived experience 
crystalize democracy
Having a voice however implies constant work, the building of knowledge, learning to resolve conflicts and sharpening intuition and phrasing are most important in the dire current political climate, characterized by an out of control capitalism, hate speech and division.
Myth function as a political catalyst to mobilize society  

The project is hosted on github and intended as a platform for a free and decentralized exchange of ideas. 

**Rules**
The game is based on nomadic.
Existing VteX-files are immutable.
[https://dicelog.com/dicelur fact and fiction]
The course of the game is mediated through individual and joint action
calling for responsibility and kindness.

**Open Call**<br>

In the process, this tale of out-of-control capitalism, inter-dimensional surveillance and robot slaying becomes strangely and poignantly relatable. 
and turn your desire for the collapse of the system into production.

Together with your fellow inhabitants you are exposed to events of horror 
such as the distortion of time and space 


You are encouraged to experiment with language and technology

You can slip into the roles of existing characters, or invent new ones,
 and model actualities on moon VteX.    

Reenacting and appropriating present conditions might be one way to approach complexities on VteX.

Join for a  mutual quest for a new homeland.
