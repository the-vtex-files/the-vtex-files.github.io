**The VteX Files** is an experimental action RPG 

 on moon VteX, a rather hostile environment  
of space-time distortion.
In the process, this tale of out-of-control capitalism, inter-dimensional surveillance and robot slaying becomes strangely and poignantly relatable. 

Quests, dialogue and descriptions are blurred with real events, frequently from the history of science & technology, 

difficulty to draw a clear line between fact and fiction. 
a politically charged entirety.
aims towards a broader perspective of reality

Another objective of the game is to challenge the ideology of linear progress by artistic intervention and to discover and enter new, hitherto unknown paths. 
Formal reasoning and a self-centered approach, 

The concept behind the game are myths.
Contrary to utopias, which are instutionalized constructs, severed from cultural and economic realities, myths, are by and for the people. 
As everyone is given a voice and access to add or modify, myths embody individual experience and are lived democracy. 


Having a voice however implies constant work, the building of knowledge, learning to resolve conflicts and sharpening intuition and phrasing are most important in the dire current political climate, characterized by an out of control capitalism, hate speech and division.

and a whitewash of a future that will never happen.
the futile task of engineering a future is handed over to the forces of chaos, which allow for authentic outcomes 

Myth function as a political catalyst to mobilize society  

The project is hosted on github and intended as a platform for a free and decentralized exchange of ideas. Not organized, which means many choices, lots of entropy randomized.

mutable /immutable , >transmuted
101 rule important
